    "content": "Try not to take on too much destination as traveling in the Philippine islands takes time. You don’t want to spend half your trip on a bus or waiting in an airport as most destinations will take a day journey. \n\nIf you would like to visit several provinces, try to plan to spend a week in each place. This is enough time to take it all in, and at the same time get as much as possible out of your trip.\n\n You should make at least a 2-day puffer after your expedition. If there is a severe weather warning or a typhoon and the Coast Guard does not give us clearance to leave in the scheduled date, we will reschedule within the next two days."
